# Sample Portal Application

This React web app is a sample for a portal that hosts other *mini applications* (so called **widgets**). Ideally, these widgets are also build with React, but in practice they could also be build with any technology.

As a proof of concept (POC) the repository contains three widgets:

- One build directly with React
- Another one build in plain JS ("vanilla JS") to demonstrate the generic usage
- Finally, a last one using Angular

Since this is a POC the code is not optimized (e.g., the possibility of extracting Angular and sharing external, lazy loaded packages, is not shown).
