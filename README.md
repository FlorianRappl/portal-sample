# Sample Portal Application

This React web app is a sample for a portal that hosts other *mini applications* (so called **widgets**). Ideally, these widgets are also build with React, but in practice they could also be build with any technology.

As a proof of concept (POC) the repository contains three widgets:

- One build directly with React
- Another one build in plain JS ("vanilla JS") to demonstrate the generic usage
- Finally, a last one using Angular

Since this is a POC the code is not optimized (e.g., the possibility of extracting Angular and sharing external, lazy loaded packages, is not shown).

## Architecture

The architecture of the portal application has been derived in such a way to decouple widgets as much as possible from the main application. Ideally, a widget could be a plain component library that additionally exposes one more function. Realistically, it will be a dedicated npm package that either consumes a component library, or was converted from an existing application.

The following diagram explains the sample by introducing the exposed REST services (in our sample its just one service, but in reality it could be two) along with the main application.

While the POC reads the widgets from the file system, a real implementation may get the packages from an internal feed (or some other data source, potentially connected to staging for different environments).

## Building the Code

Before actually building the code we need to resolve all dependencies.

We start by invoking

```bash
npm install
```

in the root directory of the repository. Furthermore, this command needs to be run for all widgets as well. There is also a simpler way to do it - just by running the following command:

```bash
npm run install-all
```

To actually build the portal sample (or *any* widget) we can run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Note that actually having a live demo of the sample should first build *all* widgets (otherwise the widgets, which have not been build, will be missing in the overview) and then start the development server. Like installing all npm packages there is a shortcut command from the root directory to build *all* widgets:

```bash
npm run build-all-widgets
```

Actually starting the development server is as simple as running:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will run two commands concurrently, namely starting the (mock) API server and the webpack dev server. The latter supports hot module reloading, but only for its own contents and not for a widget.

## What's Missing

Obviously, the given repo is just a start focusing on the main challenge. Things that would need to be tackled next (and individually) are

- provide a real widget service, maybe coupled to a (private) npm feed,
- include i18n, especially give widgets the possibilty to use it directly or use a custom solution,
- solve the issue of (shared) external libraries, e.g., that multiple widgets use Angular without bundling it directly to the widget (could greatly help to reduce the size of widgets),
- tooling to debug/run widgets locally,
- increase the portal API surface, and
- provide boilerplates (or even npm packages) for widget projects (at least React, vanilla JS, but potentially also Angular and AngularJS).
